# Voice Controlled Arduino Alarm Clock (Machine Learning & Hardware Engineering Project)
Implemented using C/C++, Python, Tensorflow, Keras, Arduino, Librosa, & Audiomentations <br>
Status: Ongoing <br>
Creators: @a6eline & @abbie_bola

the .c[...] and .h model files were derived from alarm_lite_model.tflite <br> <br>
.h and .keras model files may appear empty. They are not. The just contain datatypes github is unable to load.
+ You can view the architecture of the models by dragging and dropping the .h, .keras, and .tflite files into [Netron](https://netron.app/)
